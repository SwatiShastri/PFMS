Pension fund managemnt system-
The Pension Fund Management System (PFMS) is a comprehensive software solution developed using Java and SQL to streamline the management of pension-related activities. It automates key functions such as employee registration, pension contribution tracking, benefit projections, and withdrawal processing. By calculating retirement benefits based on factors like age, contribution amount, and service tenure, PFMS ensures accurate and efficient pension handling from start to finish.

The primary goal of PFMS is to modernize pension fund administration by enhancing transparency, compliance, and security. It aims to reduce risks, improve investment strategies, and increase trust among stakeholders. Ultimately, the system seeks to protect retirees' financial futures while optimizing operational efficiency and maintaining the integrity of the pension ecosystem.
